## Components

Adding icons into the template:

```js
// We will be using the Material Design Symbols pack
// https://icones.js.org/collection/material-symbols
<Icon icon="material-symbols:123" />
```

## Styling

Preferred font-sizes: `1.2rem`, `1.4rem`, `1.6rem` and so on
Prefered margins / paddings: increments of `5px` (NOTE: I did a global search x replace, so some things might be broken)
